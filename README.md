# 3D Environment Localization via Sensor Fusion

The 3D Environment Localization via Sensor Fusion project focuses on achieving precise localization in a 3D environment through the integration of sensor data from multiple sources. Leveraging technologies such as Microsoft Kinect RGBD cameras and TurtleBot robots controlled using ROS (Robot Operating System), this project aims to provide accurate localization capabilities for robotic systems navigating within complex environments.

## Key Features

Sensor Fusion: The project employs sensor fusion techniques to integrate data from diverse sensors, including Microsoft Kinect RGBD cameras, inertial sensors, and virtual transmitters. By combining data from multiple sources, the system enhances localization accuracy and robustness.
Reverse Projection of Sensor Data: A core component of the project involves the reverse projection of sensor data into the 3D environment. This process utilizes ray-tracing techniques to estimate depth information from inertial sensors, enabling the creation of detailed 3D maps of the environment.
Integration with ROS: The project seamlessly integrates with ROS, a flexible framework for building robotic systems. ROS facilitates communication between different components of the system, enabling efficient data exchange and coordination.
Simulation Environment: The project utilizes simulation environments such as V-rep and Turtlesim to create virtual representations of real-world scenarios. These simulated environments serve as testing grounds for evaluating localization algorithms and validating system performance.

## Getting Started

Microsoft Kinect RGBD Camera: The project leverages the depth sensing capabilities of Microsoft Kinect RGBD cameras to capture detailed 3D information about the environment. Depth data obtained from the Kinect camera is processed and integrated into the localization pipeline.
TurtleBot Robots: TurtleBot robots, controlled using ROS, serve as mobile platforms for localization experiments. Equipped with sensors and actuators, TurtleBot robots navigate within the environment, collecting sensor data for localization purposes.
Inertial Sensors: Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are utilized to estimate depth information through ray-tracing techniques. By analyzing sensor readings and applying appropriate algorithms, the system derives accurate depth estimates, enhancing localization precision.
Virtual Transmitters: Sample boundary cells within the simulated environment act as virtual transmitters, emitting signals that aid in localization. By leveraging these virtual transmitters, the system can triangulate its position relative to known reference points, further refining localization accuracy.

## Outcome

The 3D Environment Localization via Sensor Fusion project aims to deliver a robust and efficient localization solution for robotic systems operating in dynamic 3D environments. By harnessing the power of sensor fusion, reverse projection techniques, and ROS integration, the project lays the foundation for enhanced navigation and autonomy in robotic applications.
